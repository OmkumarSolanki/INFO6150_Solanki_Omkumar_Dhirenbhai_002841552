          Ice hockey (or simply hockey) is a team sport played on ice skates,
          usually on an ice skating rink with lines and markings specific to the
          sport. It belongs to a family of sports called hockey. In ice hockey,
          two opposing teams use ice hockey sticks to control, advance, and
          shoot a closed, vulcanized, rubber disc called a "puck" into the other
          team's goal. Each goal is worth one point. The team which scores the
          most goals is declared the winner. In a formal game, each team has six
          skaters on the ice at a time, barring any penalties, one of whom is
          the goaltender. Ice hockey is a full contact sport, and is considered
          to be one of the more physically demanding team sports.

          Ice hockey is one of the sports featured in the Winter Olympics while
          its premiere international competition, the IIHF World Championships,
          are governed by the International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF) for
          both men's and women's competitions.

          In North America and parts of Europe the sport is known simply as
          hockey. However, in other countries, "hockey" usually refers to field
          hockey. In 1994 hockey was officially recognized as Canada's national
          winter sport

          The modern sport of ice hockey was developed in Canada, most notably
          in Montreal, where the first indoor game was played on March 3, 1875.
          Some characteristics of that game, such as the length of the ice rink
          and the use of a puck, have been retained to this day. Amateur ice
          hockey leagues began in the 1880s, and professional ice hockey
          originated around 1900. The Stanley Cup, emblematic of ice hockey club
          supremacy, was initially commissioned in 1892 as the "Dominion Hockey
          Challenge Cup" and was first awarded in 1893 to recognize the Canadian
          amateur champion and later became the championship trophy of the
          National Hockey League (NHL). In the early 1900s, the Canadian rules
          were adopted by the Ligue Internationale de Hockey Sur Glace, in
          Paris, France, the precursor of the IIHF. The sport was played for the
          first time at the Olympics during the 1920 Summer Olympics.
